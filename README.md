# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-using-Power-Bi

-Excited to unveil my latest achievement: an HR Analytics Dashboard built with Power BI! This comprehensive dashboard empowers HR teams to gain valuable insights into attrition trends across various dimensions.
-From attrition rates based on education levels and age groups to attrition categorized by salary slabs, job roles, and years at the company, this data-driven tool enables precise decision-making.
-By leveraging this powerful resource, businesses can identify attrition patterns, implement targeted retention strategies, and foster a more engaged and stable workforce.
-My passion for data visualization and HR analytics has fueled this project, and I'm excited to help organizations thrive through evidence-based HR practices.
